# E-Commerce-Website
E-commerce website with carts. The site will show various items and whoever wants to buy will simple find its rate and book it with address details and save it to database.

This is the ecommerce website which i build during my Internshala Training.
  1)First import store.sql file on your database.
  2)Then, run the index.php file on the local server.
